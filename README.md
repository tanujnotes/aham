Aham means 'I' in Sanskrit and that's what this apps focuses on.

Aham is a Twitter client without home feed or trending page. Use it if you want to take a break from twitter while still staying in touch with your followers and tweeting every single thought that crosses your mind.
It's based on Twitter web so everything else that is available on Twitter website is available in the app. Your profile, notifications, messages etc.

Known issue: Photo/video tweets are currently not supported. It will be added later.

**NOTE**: Contributions, thoughts and ideas are welcome! Feature requests... not so much.

Thank you.

P.S. I built this app because I really needed something exactly like this, even though everyone I talked to dismissed the idea. 
I'd be very happy to hear if anyone else is finding this app useful.
